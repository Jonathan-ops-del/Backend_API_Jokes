# Backend_API_Jokes
Backend_API_Jokes

This project is a Backend API challenge problem presented by Angela Yu's Udemy Online Web Development Course. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate and teach us the use of RESTFUL API.
A RESTFUL API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources

This project consists only of a Backend API built from Nodejs, & running on port 3000. We are using Postman to test our routes. There is no database connected to our Backend API. We are simply using an Array called "Jokes."
Once the application is running you will be able to test these routes on Postman and will be able to do the following:  read random jokes, read specific jokes,  add new jokes, update our jokes array, and delete from our jokes array.


Run this project using npm.

1) To run this project you will need to clone this repo using SSH or HTTP
2) Open the folder in VS Code or applicable source-code editor with access to terminal
3) When in the terminal, use npm install to install node dependencies - "npm install."
4) Once the dependencies are installed, you can go back into the terminal and use nodemon index.js to have your API running on port 3000. - "nodemon index.js"
5) Open up postman so you can test the various HTTP request routes - there are 8 routes to test from on index.js
